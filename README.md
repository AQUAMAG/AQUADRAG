# Automated system for adhesive removal during mechanical exfoliation of 2D materials
Arduino code for a motor controller for stepper motor control of dragging adhesives for the purpose of mechanical exfoliation of 2D materials.

This software is specifically written to use an Arduino Uno with CNC shield and a TMC2209 driver utilizing the [AccelStepper](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/) and [TMCStepper](https://github.com/teemuatlut/TMCStepper) libraries.

This software can be adapted to support interfacing with different drivers through interfacing with the above linked libraries.


## 3D models:
3D printable angled substrate mounting surfaces are located in the `/3dmodels/` folder.
